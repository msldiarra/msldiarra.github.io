      <description>Nobo The SATMA Oil Manufacturing Plant (in the east of Bamako) is a pioneer in cotton processing in Mali.
Its laboratory exist since the creation of the plant back in 2000. As part of the continuous improvement of their oil production and labelling of their oil, we supported SATMA in the computerisation of their traceability system.
The Nobo application (Nobo means transparency in Bambara) involves all the teams in the factory and allows SATMA to be 100% transparent on the provenance and composition of each bottle of oil.</description>
